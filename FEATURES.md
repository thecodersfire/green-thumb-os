# Built-in features for green-thumb-os

Purpose: gardening

1. **prepare field and mapping files** — run green-thumb-os-workspace. It creates ~/Documents/green-thumb-os-workspace/ with Field Notes, Source Data, Map Exports folders.
2. **plan field work** — run green-thumb-os-plan to open a purpose-specific Markdown plan, saved under ~/Documents/green-thumb-os-session-plans/.
3. **check data and location readiness** — run green-thumb-os-check for an interactive checklist. Answers are not saved or transmitted.

These local tools create folders, open a local note, or display prompts. They do not install packages, change system settings, or send data.
